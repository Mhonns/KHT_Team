Our unique approach is based on the expressed needs of target communities and involves their local knowledge in all stages of our projects. This includes project design, implementation, maintenance and evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>Projects are focused on promoting self-reliance leading to improved well-being whilst helping Karen communities retain their unique identity and culture. Not only does this approach guarantee our projects have a positive impact in the community, it ensures community ownership and supports long-term sustainability. This creates impactful, cost-effective projects that promote sustainable outcomes for some of the poorest communities in Thailand.<\/p>\n<\/p>                                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f465f4f08b90\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--cream\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper \">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" >\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/MaeHongSon_Location-1.jpg\" alt=\"Where We Work\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\">Where We Work<\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body \"><p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>Thailand has made remarkable progress in social and economic development over the last four decades, however, improvements are mainly focused in the urban and popular southern areas. Across the rural provinces of Northern Thailand, poverty and inequality continuing to pose significant challenges, especially for ethnic minorities like the Karen.<!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>One of Thailand\u2019s least developed provinces is Mae Hong Son. This remote province, which borders Myanmar, is the most mountainous province in Thailand and over 87% of the province is covered with forest. The topography of the province also creates an extreme and harsh climate. Heavy rains and severe droughts, which have worsened in recent years due to climate change, are frequent and bring with them difficult challenges. About 64% of the population live below the global poverty line and many lack access to basic socio-economic services such as healthcare and education.<\/p>\n<p>The Mae Hong Son Province is where KHT focuses most of its attention, although we do implement some projects in neighbouring northern provinces. <!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->Most of the Karen villages we work in are only accessible from smaller roads and mud tracks. Remote villages can therefore be frequently cut off during the rainy season which lasts from July to October each year.
