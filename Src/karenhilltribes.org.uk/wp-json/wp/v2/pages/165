Many of whom belong to marginalised ethnic minorities such as the Karen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karen communities are close-knit and often situated in the mountainous areas. As an agrarian society, the most common livelihood and source of income is subsistence farming, yet the harsh conditions of the province make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed their families, let alone generate an income. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the most socially deprived and discriminated groups in Thailand, the Karen have limited access to basic socio-economic services such as health and education and, on average, Karen households earn just \u00a3644 per year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What do we do?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Karen Hilltribes Trust (KHT) is a community-led organisation working with vulnerable Karen communities in remote Mae Hong Son Province. Our mission is to empower communities to improve their health, livelihoods and access to education. By taking a holistic approach to the complex socio-economic issues at hand, we aim to achieve sustainable change and empower Karen communities across the province to improve their own lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a community-led organisation, KHT\u2019s model starts and finishes with the Karen people of Northern Thailand. Our unique approach is based on the expressed needs of target communities and involves their local knowledge in all stages of our projects. This includes project design, implementation, maintenance and evaluation.&nbsp;Not only does this approach guarantee our projects have a positive impact in the community, it ensures community ownership and supports long-term sustainability. This creates impactful, cost-effective projects that promote sustainable outcomes for some of the poorest communities in Thailand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 1986, KHT has provided over 55,000 people with clean drinking water and improved sanitation facilities, brought 2,000 acres of farmland back into production through the construction of flood-resistant irrigation systems, and increased accessed to education for over 17,000 children and young people through the provision of school meals, transport and accommodation, and higher education scholarships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large full-width\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"363\" src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/sasasa-1024x363.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3943\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/sasasa-1024x363.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/sasasa-300x106.jpg 300w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/sasasa-768x272.jpg 768w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/sasasa.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How can you help?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>KHT\u2019s aim is to provide a positive change to the lives of Karen people in Northern Thailand.
