She is one of KHT\u2019s scholarship recipients.<\/p>\n<p>Her family is a typical Karen family, her father, Mala Ei, has lived in the village for 50 years. They mainly live off subsistence farming and \u2018slash and burn\u2019 work with little disposable income for school fees. KHT met her and her family in their home during the school holidays in March 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Jintra studies computing at HVD level at vocational college. During term time she lives in a dormitory close to the college. She really enjoys her time at college where she finds sports, in particular, volleyball, really fun.<\/p>\n<\/p>                                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f60b8bff17f8\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper page-section--align-right\">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/water-system-digging.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body no-margin-xs\"><p>Mala Ei expressed how grateful he was to KHT for providing a scholarship for his daughter. He said that the scholarship was good for him because \u2018he didn\u2019t have to work in the rice fields one day and the town on another day to support his children\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>For many other families in the area, parents cannot support their children in school meaning they have to return home and work for the family. For Jintra, this would include cooking rice, washing and rice pounding, which are her responsibilities during her holidays. Other students have to work part time throughout the week leaving little time for their studies.<\/p>\n<p>Her parents were pleased she was able to continue her studies, however they were happy it was the holidays as Jintra was able to come home and see the family.<\/p>\n<p>The family have not only benefited from the scholarship project. They also live in a community that is the recent recipient of a KHT Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Project.<\/p>\n<\/p>                                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f60b906f17f9\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper \">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/jintra-and-fmaily.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body no-margin-xs\"><p>Before the water project they had to collect water from the river.
