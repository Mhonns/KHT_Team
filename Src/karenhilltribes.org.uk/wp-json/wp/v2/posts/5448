We are immensely proud of our scholarship students and their hard work in getting their degrees and giving back to their communities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms Yatika moved us with her work ethic and her story about how KHT has helped her become a teacher and given her new opportunities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&#8220;I have have four siblings and I\u2019m the second child. My father passed away when I started in junior high and my brother who was in university had to drop out and work to support us. When I graduated junior high my mother didn\u2019t have money to support me, but when I received the scholarship from KHT I was able to attend university, I also got a Student Loan and my mother had to allow me to continue my studies. I also worked part time during my holidays so I would not miss out on my education. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was hard because my family are farmers and it is very hard to earn income as a farmer. Watching my parents work hard and supporting so many children, and then losing my father made me feel very sad. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If KHT didn\u2019t support me, I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to study at university and would have likely become a farmer like my parents. Nowadays I have a better life and I can take care of myself and my mother.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>KHT\u2019s project improves educational opportunities for disadvantaged children, this helps children follow their dreams, it can be said that the KHT\u2019s project is a project to create dreams for underprivileged children. This project is very good and useful for us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>KHT helped me with the cost of living, such as documents, meals, boarding fees, fuel costs, etc, if I didn\u2019t get KHT\u2019s support I wouldn\u2019t have continued studying.&nbsp;Although studying and living away from home is very expensive and I still needed a loan and help from my brother at times, KHT&#8217;s scholarship was vital in helping finish my studies. I was able to follow my dream and become a teacher rather than have a job I don&#8217;t like. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m so glad and happy that you could help me towards my goal of becoming a teacher and whilst I was studying I would lookforw ard to the money from KHT as it was a reminder of the amazing support I was getting and to keep doing well.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope KHT will continue this project for new generations who cannot afford to study but want to continue their education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for your support giving me my chance to study and have a better life.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yatika is just one of 46 talented and hardworking students we sponsor, and we want to keep supporting them and reaching out to more disadvantaged Karen youth.
