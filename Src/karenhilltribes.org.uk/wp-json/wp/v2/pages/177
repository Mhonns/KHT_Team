By becoming a Teaching volunteer, you will be at the forefront of helping these less privileged children learn and develop, to ensure their future is one of opportunity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a volunteer teacher, you will be primarily focusing on spoken English and developing the confidence of the students. The local teachers are often good at teaching the grammar and structure of the English language but when it comes to speaking, many lack confidence and won\u2019t have good pronunciation skills. Children enjoy the fun elements that our volunteer teachers often inject into lessons, especially activities like songs and games, which help bring English alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteers can also help by teaching other subjects alongside English. Depending on your skills and interests, you could get involved in organizing extra-curricular activities such as art, drama, music, sports, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning English for Karen students is critical. It allows students to expand their employment opportunities and increases their social status. By signing up to be a teaching volunteer, you will provide others with new opportunities but also learn a lot yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So far, we have a community of 191 volunteers. Apply now to become part of the team!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-Volunteer-School-Small-0253-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-Volunteer-School-Small-0253-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-Volunteer-School-Small-0253-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-Volunteer-School-Small-0253-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-Volunteer-School-Small-0253.jpg 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<section class=\"one-column-text one-column-text--transparent \" id=\"one-column-text-block_5f69b640670c1\">\n    <div class=\"one-column-text__container\">\n                <blockquote><p>\u201cWhy was it such a good experience going to Thailand with KHT?
