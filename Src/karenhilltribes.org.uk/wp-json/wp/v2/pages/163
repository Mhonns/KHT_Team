Communities in these areas remain poverty stricken and other organisations are unable to reach them. With your help we are aiming to ensure all Karen people have access to the basic needs in life; clean water, enough food and a chance of an education. We have worked hard to build up strong relationships with the Karen people and all our projects are led by the Karen, ensuring that the future of their tight knit community is sustainable and the rich Karen culture is not diminished.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can help us on this journey to empowering the Karen people, and provide thousands with hope for the future, by remembering us in your Will today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>A Guide to Leaving a Gift in Your Will<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>By leaving a legacy to KHT in your Will, you will be helping us to give more Karen people hope for the future. The process of leaving a gift is not as complicated as you may think. To aid you in your journey we have provided some key information below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why write a Will?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Will is one of the most important documents you can write, allowing you to lay out your exact wishes for your money. Through your Will you can ensure your loved ones are looked after and give to charitable causes which are close to your heart. If you do not make a Will the state will decide how your assets are distributed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why remember a charity in your Will?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Legacies are the largest source of voluntary income for charities and their importance cannot be underestimated. Remembering KHT in your Will, will allow us to continue to work towards bringing sustainable change to the Karen, giving the poorest group of people in Northern Thailand hope for the future. Any gifts you leave to charity will also not be subject to tax and will lower the level of Inheritance Tax your Will is subject to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How can I leave a gift?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving a gift to charity in your Will is easy to do, simply contact a Solicitor and inform them you would like to include KHT and what you would like to leave. If you would like to leave a gift to KHT in your Will there are different ways this can be done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pecuniary gift &#8211; a set amount of money<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to leave this type of gift to KHT, we suggest the following wording:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI give [amount] to The Karen Hilltribes Trust, Tower House Business Centre, Fishergate, York, YO10 4UA&nbsp; (registered Charity No 1093548) to be used by The Karen Hilltribes Trust for its general purposes, and I direct that the receipt of the Hon Treasurer or other duly authorised officer shall be sufficient discharge of the said legacy\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specific gift \u2013 a specific possession for example an antique<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to leave this type of gift to KHT, we suggest the following wording<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI give [specific item] to The Karen Hilltribes Trust, Tower House Business Centre, Fishergate, York, YO10 4UA&nbsp; (registered Charity No 1093548) to be used by The Karen Hilltribes Trust for its general purposes, and I direct that the receipt of the Hon Treasurer or other duly authorised officer shall be sufficient discharge of the said legacy\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A residuary gift &#8211; a share or percentage of your estate after all other gifts to friends and family have been made<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to leave this type of gift to KHT, we suggest using the following wording:<br><br>\u201cI give [enter percentage] percent of my residuary estate to The Karen Hilltribes Trust, Tower House Business Centre, Fishergate, York, YO10 4UA&nbsp;(registered Charity No 1093548) to be used by The Karen Hilltribes Trust for its general purposes, and I direct that the receipt of the Hon Treasurer or other duly authorised officer shall be sufficient discharge of the said legacy\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Information to give to your Solicitor<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the process as simple as possible it is advisable before visiting your Solicitor, if you wish to write a new Will, to make a list of the approximate value of everything you wish to leave behind. The next step is to then decide who you would like this to go to. Following thinking about your loved ones and ensuring they are looked after, we hope that you may consider KHT as part of the remaining sum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our details, which can be found below, will need to be given to your Solicitor:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Karen Hilltribes Trust<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tower House Business Centre&nbsp;<br>Fishergate&nbsp;<br>York&nbsp;<br>YO10 4UA&nbsp;<br>United Kingdom<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered Charity No: 1093548<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already have a Will and do not wish to write an entirely new one, you can simply make alterations through a codicil document, if you wish to leave a gift to KHT. These however need to be witnessed in the same way that your original Will was when first written.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<aside class=\"cta cta--transparent\" id=\"cta-block_5f58e85a041af\">\n    <div class=\"cta__container\">\n        <div class=\"cta__text\">If you have any questions about how to remember KHT in your Will, then do not hesitate to get in touch<\/div>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/about-us\/contact-us\/\" class=\"cta__link\">\n            Contact Us        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n<\/aside>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leave a Gift in your Will Through leaving&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":2585,"parent":159,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false},"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.12 -
