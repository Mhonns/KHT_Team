The COVID-19 pandemic has swept across the globe, threatening lives, the economy and practically everything else in its path.<\/p>\n<p>The United Nations (UN) estimates that more than 1 billion children are at risk of falling behind due to school closures and reduced livelihoods, whilst, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the pandemic has caused economic and social disruption that puts tens of millions of people at risk of falling into extreme poverty, decreasing food security and causing widespread malnutrition. It is therefore now even more important than ever to support vulnerable families around the world.<\/p>\n<p>This is also the case for the Karen communities we work with in Northern Thailand. The outbreak has had a huge impact on daily life, and has resulted in a decrease in employment opportunities and reduced access to education. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, many families were already living well below the poverty line and so now have even less disposable income to support their households than before. This situation therefore makes our work vital to empower communities to respond to the pandemic and continue to improve their lives!<\/p>\n<\/p>                                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5fc8a5bcb4e86\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper page-section--align-right\">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" >\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Website-Xmas-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body no-margin-xs\"><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, the pandemic has also had devastating consequences for the charity sector, especially for smaller organisations like KHT. As the economy has been hugely affected by the pandemic, most charities have seen a decrease in funding available to support their work. In addition, without being able to meet in person, it has been increasingly difficult to raise vital funds through hosting fundraising events. This has made it very challenging to secure the support we need to conduct our projects.<\/p>\n<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the importance of our projects, we are working hard to raise funds so that next year we do not need to reduce our support to the communities in Northern Thailand. Therefore, to ensure that we can continue to support as many communities as possible, we have set an ambitious target of raising \u00a320,000 this Christmas, which we know we can accomplish together with your support and involvement!<\/p>\n<p>In this crazy year that is 2020, we have, together with you and your support, been able to improve the lives of over 3,800 Karen people; an amazing achievement! We are extremely grateful to have such amazing supporters and we want to say thank you to every single person who has helped us and the Karen communities this year. You are incredible and are the reason we can continue our work!<\/p>\n<\/p>                                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5fc8a6a29c642\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper \">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" >\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Website-Xmas-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body \"><p>However, with your continuous support, we can achieve even more in 2021. Our ambitious target of raising \u00a320,000 through this year\u2019s Christmas Appeal will help ensure that we can implement projects across Northern Thailand next year! By reaching this target, we are expected to be able to help a further 3,500 Karen people through the construction of a minimum of six water systems, five new irrigation systems and providing 38 communities with access to education.<\/p>\n<p>To support this appeal, throughout December, we will be uploading updates and posts every day to our social media accounts to share how YOU can get involved! If you are able to donate to our campaign this Christmas, we would be extremely grateful to have your support, however big or small the gift you can offer may be.<\/p>\n<p>To donate, visit the donation page on our website by clicking the donate button below! All of your support will contribute towards creating a better tomorrow for Karen communities and you can be sure that every penny you may be able to offer will make a difference that lasts!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters.
