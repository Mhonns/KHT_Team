<p>I am Julia. Born and raised in Thailand by English parents. Granddad came out in 1904 to help build the railway from Bangkok to Chiengmai and some of the family remained here. After graduating with a degree in political science I joined an insurance company and now am working as a Consultant for Univentures PCL., a Company that deals mostly in real estate development.&nbsp;My husband is Thai (retired from the Army) and we have two daughters.&nbsp;</p>
