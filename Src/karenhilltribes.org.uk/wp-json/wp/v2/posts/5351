His youngest daughter is studying at university and his son is a soldier. Su Phot helped in the construction of our WASH system and he told us that life in the village has been very difficult. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We help each other and we were happy to help building KHT\u2019s project. We organised ourselves so there would be enough people every day and so we could also do our own farming. I have to grow rice to feed myself and my family but without more water, it is the only thing I can grow.<\/p><cite>Su Phot<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The village is near a main road which means it is better connected and why it is so densely populated. However, like many Karen villages, it is still neglected when it comes to vital infrastructure and economic support. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The older government water system was no longer safe and did not provide enough water as the village has increased in size since it was built decades ago. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We have needed this help for a long time but because we are a big village, no one has wanted to help us. Water is the most important issue that we need help with. Water is very important for life. The latrines help our health and make our lives easier. <\/p><cite>Su Phot<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the WASH System, KHT also carried out its hygiene education and provided recommendations and knowledge to help them improve their hygiene, protect themselves from Covid-19 and how best to keep the new latrines cleaner and usable. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-09-26-at-7.19.43-AM-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5353\" width=\"519\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-09-26-at-7.19.43-AM-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-09-26-at-7.19.43-AM-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-09-26-at-7.19.43-AM-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-09-26-at-7.19.43-AM.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" \/><figcaption>Hygiene education session led by our M&amp;E Officer and WASH Team<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>KHT are very grateful that the Karen villagers were eager to help with the labour-intensive construction and organised themselves to provide support every day.
