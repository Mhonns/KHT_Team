As our team was working on constructing a new WASH system for the village, fighting on the other side of the border led to an influx of refugees into the area. The conflict on the other side of the border is rarely in international news, but it is ongoing and there are ongoing humanitarian consequences for those fleeing into Thailand as well as an impact on the Thailand&#8217;s Karen people who live in these border areas. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team spent a month in the village, and we spoke with Mr Jaiin, a farmer from the village and father of two daughters. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-08-04T154332.079-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14055\" width=\"483\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-08-04T154332.079-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-08-04T154332.079-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-08-04T154332.079.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What difficulties have him and his family faced living in Ban Pa Khae <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>My daughters are studying to become nurses and my wife and I works are farmers.

We don&#8217;t have electricity and use solarcells for power, and the roads to the village have not improved much in the years. We have collected water with bamboo and this water system is something we have needed for a long time! We do not have enough water in the summer months and just about enough during the rainy season. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>How have KHT helped you and your village? <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>KHT has helped us build a water system that brings water to our village and this water will be available for us all year round and is cleaner than the water we collect right now. We feel so grateful for your support. This system will help us have more water to use and will help our health too.

It is also helpful to the village that we were able to complete our project before the refugee crisis in the area began. With the presence of more people, it is much more difficult to gain permission to safely work in the area. The water system will greatly support the village and will also likely help some of the refugees that have settled there too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-08-04T154305.690.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14056\" width=\"525\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-08-04T154305.690.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-08-04T154305.690-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-08-04T154305.690-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-08-04T154305.690-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" \/><figcaption>Our M&amp;E Officer carrying out vital water testing of the source <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many villages close to the border have been chronically under-developed and forgotten because they are in a precarious location.
