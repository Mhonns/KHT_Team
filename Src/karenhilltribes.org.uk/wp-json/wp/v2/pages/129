It is estimated that 48% of Karen children are infected with intestinal worms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequent or chronic infections can also cause impaired growth and brain development contributing to reduced performance levels. Poor health can result in low enrollment, attendance, and retention rates lead to poor long-term educational and livelihood outcomes, helping continue the cycle of poverty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Before the project, w<em>e had problems in all seasons.<\/em> <em>Now we have water all of the year.
