The roads around the village are in poor condition and the village is spread across a large area. The remote village has struggled with lack of access to clean water, and many families are forced to use unsafe well water or walk to the stream that is far away to collect water. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In dry season, there is much less water and only a few houses have access to the government water system that is also in poor condition. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mrs. Wilaillak is a 40 year old mother of two girls who lives in Ban Thuan and is a farmer. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I didn\u2019t have the chance to study and I stopped going to school in primary school. My mother passed away and I looked after my siblings. My father didn\u2019t have enough to send us all to school and my brothers were able to receive a free education as a Christian school in the city.<\/p><p>We barely had enough money for food and clothes and traveling to the city was beyond our reach.<\/p><p>KHT\u2019s support has been very helpful. We used to use water from the well or creek water which is quite far. We would have to wait in line to get water and if you had a car or motorbike it is ok but v difficult for those without.\u00a0<\/p><p>Although people offer to help, many people feel ashamed to keep asking neighbours for help when they needed water. Without water our life is so difficult.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" data-id=\"13915\"  src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/620.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13915\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/620.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/620-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/620-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/620-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption>KHT&#8217;s Water System is ready for the villagers <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"1200\" data-id=\"13914\"  src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e16\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07-\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e16\u0e27\u0e19_\u0e52\u0e53\u0e50\u0e54\u0e51\u0e57_46_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13914\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e16\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07-\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e16\u0e27\u0e19_\u0e52\u0e53\u0e50\u0e54\u0e51\u0e57_46_0.jpg 900w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e16\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07-\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e16\u0e27\u0e19_\u0e52\u0e53\u0e50\u0e54\u0e51\u0e57_46_0-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e16\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07-\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e16\u0e27\u0e19_\u0e52\u0e53\u0e50\u0e54\u0e51\u0e57_46_0-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><figcaption>The villagers support the project by helping construction<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>KHT helped to provide a water system and latrines and we couldn&#8217;t afford this alone. The villagers participated in the construction and although it was hard work, it made us feel good to do this.<\/p><p>Having enough water to use each day has eased so many burdens and made life easier. We will also have better health and less diseases from the dirty water. The project will help every aspect of our life from our livelihoods and health and also keep our kids healthy too.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The village of Ban Thuan is split into 5 sections that are spread quite far from each other. The roads are in bad condition and it can be hard for people to travel to and from the village, especially in rainy season.  Some houses closer to the main road so they have been able to pay for water from the old government system, however even this doesn&#8217;t mean access to enough water. KHT&#8217;s support will make a big difference for the village and after years of struggling the village will not be facing facing poverty. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I want my daughters to have what I didn&#8217;t so I have made sure they are studying.
