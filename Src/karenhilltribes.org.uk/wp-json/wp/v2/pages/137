These courses increase employment and livelihood opportunities for scholarship recipients and their families and contribute to social change on a larger scale. KHT believes that scholarships are key in helping communities become more self-sufficient, improving their economic well-being and helping them escape from the poverty that keeps communities in Mae Hong Son vulnerable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So far, KHT has supported 155 scholarship students. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-High-School-Small-1738-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-High-School-Small-1738-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-High-School-Small-1738-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-High-School-Small-1738-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/KHT-High-School-Small-1738.jpg 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<section class=\"one-column-text one-column-text--transparent \" id=\"one-column-text-block_5f59feeca677b\">\n    <div class=\"one-column-text__container\">\n                <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What is the Higher Education Scholarship project?<\/strong><\/h1>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f5f26f4fd9f5\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper \">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/MG_1527.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body \"><p>Through the Higher Education Scholarships Project, KHT supports 45 students with scholarships to cover tuition and living costs whilst studying. The scholarships provide a practical means of making higher education accessible and make it possible for Karen youths to find sustainable livelihoods.<\/p>\n<p>Students who receive the scholarship tend to use the money to pay for their tuition fees (3,500 THB; 119 USD per term) and other accompanying costs. These include the fees students pay to stay in dormotories during term-time (500 THB; 17 USD per term), which many need due to the distance from their homes to school, and the costs of food, uniform and stationary.<\/p>\n<\/p>                                    <a href=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/get-involved\/donate\/\" class=\"page-section__cta\">Donate<\/a>                                                    <a href=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/get-involved\/\" class=\"page-section__cta-two\">Get Involved<\/a>                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section class=\"impact\" id=\"impact-block_5f5f2b51fd9f7\">\n    <div class=\"impact__wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"impact__header\">\n            <h2 class=\"impact__title no-margin-md\">\n                            <\/h2>\n                    <\/div>\n\n        <ul class=\"impact__items\">\n                                            <li class=\"impact__item\">\n                    <h3>155<\/h3>\n                    <p class=\"no-margin-xs\">Graduates since the start of the programme<\/p> \n                <\/li>\n                                            <li class=\"impact__item\">\n                    <h3>45<\/h3>\n                    <p class=\"no-margin-xs\">Students currently receiving support<\/p> \n                <\/li>\n                                            <li class=\"impact__item\">\n                    <h3>20<\/h3>\n                    <p class=\"no-margin-xs\">Years of supplying scholarships<\/p> \n                <\/li>\n                    <\/ul>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f5f2adefd9f6\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper page-section--align-right\">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/MG_3101.jpg\" alt=\"Jintra's story\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\">Jintra&#8217;s story<\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body \"><p>Jintra studies computing at HVD level at vocational college.

For Jintra, this would include cooking rice, washing and rice pounding, which are her responsibilities during her holidays.
