Education <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>KHT held a reunion event for some of our students recently and it was an opportunity to hear from them about their struggles, their successes and how KHT&#8217;s support is making a difference. We gave them a short presentation on our work and our aims and goals when supporting the Karen people. We had discussion about what they have found difficult being Karen students in university and vocational education, what keeps them motivated, why they chose the paths they have and what they hope for their futures. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read some of their responses below: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I am sometimes afraid to speak Thai because my accent makes me stand out and I worry I am not communicating clearly. People often ask where I am from and I proudly say I am Karen. I chose to become a science teacher because my science teacher was my idol. They made the subject interesting, I never felt bored and I loved learning!<\/p><cite>Thidaporn, studying to be a science teacher<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I sometimes worry about being in the city and that my accent will lead to people bullying me but I also try to remember my own worth and that I will show people my strength and achieve equality. I am studying to become a nurse because I live close to the border and we have very few health facilities for people. I want to work in my hometown and help improve healthcare and also inspire other young Karen to pursue this career. I do worry if I will be a good nurse and not know what to do but I will work hard and do my best!<\/p><cite>Thira, studying to become a nurse <\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-05-15T110042.150-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13895\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-05-15T110042.150-2.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-05-15T110042.150-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-05-15T110042.150-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was worried about the cost of studying and and I get nervous when I need to speak English, as well as Thai. One of my biggest fears is that I can get shy and sometimes I am not assertive and this will cost me opportunities.

I feel like us students from the villages are less assertive and it is harder for us to be confident. This is one disadvantage we have are Karen youth and we need to overcome it. I want to be a nurse so I can help my family and also help society. After Covid, it made me think and we may have other pandemics and we have epidemics now and I would like to be someone that is being useful and helpful. <\/p><cite>Juthathip, studying to become a nurse <\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Coming from a remote village, I know my education isn&#8217;t as good as people from the city. It has been hard to adapt in university as I was not taught some things, but others were and I have to try and keep up. I chose to teach English because I had such a great English teacher that made the subject fun. I also want to become more confident and not be shy to speak English myself.
