We currently support over 40 students and we are always happy to hear from them and learn about their plans and successes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nattapon&#8217;s Story <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nattapon, age 23, is one of our scholarship students and will be graduating this year! He is the oldest of 3 siblings and is the first person in his immediate family to go to university. Nattapon discovered KHT&#8217;s scholarship programme via his secondary school and successfully applied. He not only benefits from KHT&#8217;s scholarship but his village was also supported by our FRIS (Flood resistant irrigation system). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is studying Art and Education and will begin training to become an art teacher in Chonburi province after his graduation. He has a passion for art and it is something he knows he will like working in everyday. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I will miss home moving away but there are more opportunities in the bigger cities and I will be able to get ready to take the government exam to become a teacher. This will open more doors and benefits for me.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Karen youth are aware that there are less opportunities in Mae Hong Son and therefore they study or work in other provinces. This can be difficult and a culture shock for them but Nattapon told us:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;The Karen people are friendly and helpful and in the cities it is much less like this. It can be lonely and you can face discrimination but I keep my Karen values and treat people kindly and have the same attitude I would have at home.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a sense of ambition and perseverance are vital for Karen youth who face many obstacles to achieving their dreams. Scholarships provide a sense of support and security for Karen students. Nattapon was able to concentrate on his ambition to become a teacher because he had vital financial support to access education. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"13804\"  src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-04T075326.106.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13804\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-04T075326.106.jpg 768w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-04T075326.106-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"13801\"  src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-04T072313.053.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13801\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-04T072313.053.jpg 768w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-04T072313.053-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Thank you for supporting me for these 4 years.
