It is one of the most important tools to break the cycle of poverty and prevent exploitation of the most vulnerable. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Northern Thailand, an area that has seen little development over the years, the enrollment of Karen children in primary education is just 51% (compared to national average at 89%) whilst only 1 in 4 Karen children complete their secondary education.  One of the main reasons for the low number of children enrolled is the distance to schools. KHT is dedicated to increase access to education for marginalised Karen communities through projects that are coordinated in cooperation with every village we work in to ensure long-term sustainability and local ownership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently we have four Access to education projects &#8211; School Transport, School Meals, Higher Education Scholarships and School dormitories. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So far our projects have provided access to education for 17,420  Karen children!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f478fa4ce0a7\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--yellow\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper page-section--align-right\">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/PortraitsDress020-e1600780997396.jpg\" alt=\"One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\">One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world<\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body no-margin-xs\"><p><!-- wp:quote --><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8211; Malala Yousafzai<\/em><\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:quote --><\/p>\n<\/p>                                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:75px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"current-projects\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Current Projects<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f478d3cbf86c\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper \">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/school-bus3-e1600788019764.jpg\" alt=\"School Transport\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\">School Transport<\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body \"><p>The provision of a school transport service is a simple solution to ensuring access to education for Karen communities.
