Most communities within the province have a primary school within ten kilometres of the village, however secondary schools are limited to the larger towns and can be located up to 50 km away, whilst higher education establishments can be even further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of the long distances to school, many children move into school dormitories. The school dormitories provide a possibility for children from distant locations to attend school. However, it is not free, and the families must provide the children with their own food. Many families in the Karen communities already struggle financially and cannot always support their children throughout the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, government support is limited, meaning that food supplies are often inadequate. This can result in children not having enough to eat affecting school performance and overall well-being. In some cases, this can even lead to student\u2019s dropping out of school to seek employment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To relieve the financial pressure for Karen parents, KHT provides financial support to schools through the School Meals Project to ensure that all children that stay in the school dormitories get three nutritious meals every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Today we supply 400 children with three meals per day from eight different schools. That is 324 000 meals per year!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/41272392_747715042255978_6067298826438311936_n-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2835\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/41272392_747715042255978_6067298826438311936_n-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/41272392_747715042255978_6067298826438311936_n-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/41272392_747715042255978_6067298826438311936_n-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/41272392_747715042255978_6067298826438311936_n.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<section class=\"one-column-text one-column-text--white \" id=\"one-column-text-block_5f58d8794b574\">\n    <div class=\"one-column-text__container\">\n                <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What is the School Meals Project?<\/strong><\/h1>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f58d8da4b575\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper \">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Dinners001.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body \"><p>The School Meals Project supports 400 Karen children studying at eight schools through the provision of school meals. The school meals will provide children with the nutrition they need when living in school dormitories and make it possible for the children to attend school in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Without access to food whilst studying, children do not perform well, and their mental and physical health deteriorates. The school meals will also reduce the risk of school drop-out dramatically and allow the children to perform better and have better health, which in the long-term mean access to quality education.<\/p>\n<\/p>                                    <a href=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/get-involved\/donate\/\" class=\"page-section__cta\">Donate<\/a>                                                    <a href=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/get-involved\/\" class=\"page-section__cta-two\">Get Involved<\/a>                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section class=\"impact\" id=\"impact-block_5f5f5529f9fb4\">\n    <div class=\"impact__wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"impact__header\">\n            <h2 class=\"impact__title no-margin-md\">\n                            <\/h2>\n                    <\/div>\n\n        <ul class=\"impact__items\">\n                                            <li class=\"impact__item\">\n                    <h3>400<\/h3>\n                    <p class=\"no-margin-xs\"> Children are provided with 3 meals every day<\/p> \n                <\/li>\n                                            <li class=\"impact__item\">\n                    <h3>324,000<\/h3>\n                    <p class=\"no-margin-xs\">Meals have been provided since the start of the project<\/p> \n                <\/li>\n                                            <li class=\"impact__item\">\n                    <h3>7,000<\/h3>\n                    <p class=\"no-margin-xs\">Students have had increased access to education thanks to the project<\/p> \n                <\/li>\n                    <\/ul>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f5f55c4f9fb5\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper \">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/41673961_462854704122433_3483106691942187008_n.jpg\" alt=\"More than words thank you!\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\">More than words thank you!<\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body \"><p>&#8220;My name is Kritsana.
