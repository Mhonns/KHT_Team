Prior to volunteering in Thailand, Alice gave up her time to intern in the UK KHT office where she first found out about the work of KHT and is today completing her Masters in International Development at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. Find out below just how big an impact volunteering in a Karen village had on Alice\u2019s life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f60bd24c70e1\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper \">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Alice-water-volunteer.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body no-margin-xs\"><p><strong>Why did you choose to volunteer with KHT?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During my time as intern, I learnt lots about the projects that KHT works on with the Karen and liked how local ownership and sustainability were at the forefront of all the work. This community led focus also expands to the volunteer projects, which is in contrast to the \u2018voluntourism\u2019 of so many other organisations.<\/p>\n<p><em>They aren\u2019t working for the Karen, instead working with the Karen.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I also was interested in a career in international development and wanted to gain practical experience working in the field with communities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Was the experience what you expected?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was more emotionally challenging that I thought it would be but it was great to be able to overcome this and I learnt a lot about myself. The community led aspect of the project is very much what I imagined as you really do experience living with the Karen people and seeing life through their eyes.<\/p>\n<\/p>                                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f60bd83c70e2\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper page-section--align-right\">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Feeding-animals.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body no-margin-xs\"><p><strong>What was the best thing about your time volunteering?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The best thing was how it allowed me to develop personally, as you have the space and time to reflect due to being so removed from normal life. As the project is so independent and you do initially experience a big culture shock, it gave me the confidence to realise that I was capable of working within the development world.<\/p>\n<p><em>It gave me a good idea of what field work is like and I left feeling like \u2018I can!\u2019<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It was also fun to experience the project in a group, as you come away with unique memories shared and really do end up supporting each other as you overcome difficulties, such as the isolation.<\/p>\n<\/p>                                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f60bbd1c70de\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper \">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Alice-water-volunteer-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body no-margin-xs\"><p><strong>What was the most challenging part?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You do experience a sense of isolation and are thrown in at the deep end but as I said before, having a supportive group to share these things with really does help. Equally, spending so much time with the same group can be challenging and tensions do inevitably arise.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Were you able to build relationships with the Karen despite language barriers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The villagers, particularly the women, were very sweet to us and did try and communicate. Something that normally ended up with lots of laughter! We were made to feel very welcome, and they really did make an effort, taking us on trips at the weekends, inviting us over and presenting us all with handmade Karen tops at the end of project.<\/p>\n<\/p>                                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section id=\"page-section-block_5f60bbe9c70df\" \nclass=\"page-section page-section--transparent\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"page-section__wrapper page-section--align-right\">\n            <div class=\"page-section__image\" style=\"max-height:400px\">\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/child-smiling.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"page-section__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"page-section__title\"><\/h2>\n                                <p class=\"page-section__body no-margin-xs\"><p><strong>Has your experience had an impact on what you are doing today?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It has given me great practical knowledge of sustainable projects in action and equipped me well for the International Development Masters I am now completing in Geneva.
