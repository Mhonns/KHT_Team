It is also an important tool of empowerment and is making a positive difference in the lives of the students, their families and Karen society. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The generosity of the Lloyd George Asia Foundation has allowed us to help students like Uthumporn,  Benjapha and Chiwa.  They were all encouraged to apply to the scholarship by a former KHT scholar that became their teacher! This shows the long term impact and trust in KHT across our beneficiaries. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Uthumporn&#8217;s Story: <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Uthumporn is studying Chinese and hopes that learning the language will help her work better in a trading company owned by a family member. She hopes it will make her a better employee in the future and also help her learn more about business. She will be graduating in 2025 and is settling into life as a student. She is the first person in her family to go to university, and is also a care-taker for her injured Step-father and her younger brother.  She works part time to help them and she said that although she enjoyed Chinese in high school, she told us it is much more difficult and it means studying can be stressful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>KHT&#8217;s scholarship takes a burden off her shoulders and has allowed her to continue in her degree. It has meant she has not had to take out a hefty loan that she would have struggled to pay, further delaying or stopping her education. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Thank you to KHT. The scholarship has helped my independence and I am grateful to have you helping me and looking out for me!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"13826\"  src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-17T083603.946-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13826\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-17T083603.946-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-17T083603.946-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-17T083603.946-1.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-id=\"13825\"  src=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-17T080434.588-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13825\" srcset=\"https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-17T080434.588-2.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-17T080434.588-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/karenhilltribes.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/MicrosoftTeams-image-2023-04-17T080434.588-2-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benjapha&#8217;s Story: <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Benjapha is 21 and is studying elementary education.

Like other Karen students, she has faced some discrimination and stereotypes whilst at university, but she is grateful to have other Karen students studying in Chiang Mai for her to spend time with. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benjapha is grateful to KHT for supporting her as it has helped to pay for her course and the supplies she needs. She feels pressure to do well as the first in her family to go onto higher education, but her siblings are following in her footsteps and she wants to make her parents and family proud. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;KHT&#8217;s support has helped me and my family.
